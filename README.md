# reap-aarch64
This repo contains instructions in order to run REAP [1] in an aarch64 processor.
REAP is a technique to reduce the time it takes to spawn a firecracker microVM using snapshots.
We adopt REAP code as given by the authors of the FaaSnap paper [2].
The author's code can be found in their github repo (https://github.com/ucsdsysnet/faasnap) however it is not
ready to run in aarch64 processors, only on x86_64.
In order to run it on an aarch64 processor we needed to change a few things in their code. Below we give the
detailed instructions on how we managed to run their code in an aarch64 processors (namely, Neoverse-V2).

## Step 1: Build linux kernel for guest microVMs.
We were able to run a vanilla linux kernel inside a firecracker microVM with no modifications.
So, this step is simply a download and build of a linux kernel:
```
wget https://cdn.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/v5.x/linux-5.15.178.tar.xz
tar xvf linux-5.15.178.tar.xz
cd linux-5.15.178/
cp config-5.15.178-reap-iccs ./.config
make menuconfig
make -j
ls arch/arm64/boot/Image
```

## Step 2: Build firecracker.
With our changes in REAP+faasnap code we are able to run REAP using a vanilla latest version of firecracker.
```
git clone https://github.com/firecracker-microvm/firecracker.git
cd firecracker
git checkout tags/v1.12.0-dev
tools/devtool build
ls build/cargo_target/aarch64-unknown-linux-musl/debug
```

## Step 3: Install Redis server and populate it with the functionsâ€™ inputs:
We provide in the current repo a populate_redis.py file which can be used to 
```
apt install redis-server python3-pip
pip3 install redis
python3 populate_redis.py
Validate with redis-cli:
auth <pass>
keys *
```
